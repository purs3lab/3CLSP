## My `clangd` server won't start up?
{: .text-purple-000}
The tool is still in development and may crash from time to time. Although them ain reason for a crash maybe the absence of a compile database. Make sure that your folder has a `compile_commands.json`. 

## My Code won't compile after conversion?
{: .text-purple-000}
The tool tries it's best to convert as much code as possible. It fails to convert code that requires major refactoring. If you're converting `tiny-bignum-c`, visit [this link for more info.](https://github.com/secure-sw-dev/checkedc-tiny-bignum-c#initial-conversion). Also make sure that you have the correct `clang` in your `PATH`. 

## Clang: Command not found.
{: .text-purple-000}
This error states that the `clang` compiler executable was not found. Make sure you followed the [PATH instructions](https://purs3lab.github.io/3clsp/docs/installation/checkedC.html#path-instructions), as they are vital to your clang working in your terminal window.

## I get Compilation Errors while using the tool to convert.
{: .text-purple-000}
You may get some compilation errors while trying to compile certain libraries with Checked C clang. For instance, we got the following error while trying to compile `Icecast` server.
![](../assets/images/compileerror.png)

This is because of compatibility issues with `GNU_SOURCE` macros. We fixed it by removing the definition of this macro in the configure script.

```sh
cd icecast-2.4.4
sed -i '/_GNU_SOURCE/d' configure
```
