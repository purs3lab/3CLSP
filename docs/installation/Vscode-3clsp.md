# [](#header-1) The VSCode Extension

If you followed all the previous steps then, you should have VScode (a fancy code editor) installed on your system. VSCode allows you to install extensions, which as the name suggests extend the functionalities of the editor and provides extra features. We use this extensions as a way to integrate **3C**, our tool with VSCode. You can go to the extension marketplace or just press `Ctrl+Shift+X` and type in *3clsp*. You should be greeted by a screen that looks like this:

Click on install and reload your editor. You're now set. You can now open up a project and start converting.
