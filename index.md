# A better &  easier way to convert your unsafe code
{: .fs-9 }

3CLSP gives you the power to convert your **legacy C code** to a memory-safe version of C called **CheckedC**. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Introduction
CheckedC was developed by Microsoft as an extension to the regular **C** we know and love but adds checking to C to detect or prevent common programming errors such as buffer overruns, out-of-bounds memory accesses, and incorrect type casts.
